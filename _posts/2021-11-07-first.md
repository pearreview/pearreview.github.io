Today marks one month and 4 days since Victoria and I arrived in Basel, Switzerland.
We met six years ago in Montreal, where I had lived since I was 4 and a half years old.
After four years of PhD studies, I got an offer for a 2 year postdoc at [ETH Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich).
There haven't been too many new beginnings in my life (at least not in my adult life) but this one certainly felt like a big one.
For that reason, I felt the urge to write down what was happening during this period.
Not only does this feel like a big turning point in mine and Victoria's life but it certainly feels like the world is generating a lot of situations that need to be broken down and reflected on.
So this marks the beginning of the attempt at doing just that, from the point of view of everyday life.

Being in Switzerland has presented many firsts for us, and today is another one. 
We are about to go on our first corss-border walk.
The price of food (especially chicken breast, which is a staple in my North American diet) is quite high here.
From our first inspections, 300g of chicken breast is costing around 7 CHF (approx. 10 CAD).
Since we are still adjusting to the new budgeting; this is my first time fully providing for myself and someone else, we are exploring what seems to be a popular option of shopping across the border.
Basel is nicely located extremely close to the border with France and Germany; Google Maps, and my preferred open source alternative, [OSM+](https://osmand.net/), estimate about a 35 minute walk to a grocery shop in (St. Louis, France)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Haut-Rhin].
We haven't yet figured out if we're going to buy a car, or use the seemingly popular car share service, (Mobility)[https://www.mobility.ch/en/private-customers] so we're walking.
In any case, I've gotten used to a 30 minute walk to my office in [Kleinbasel](https://www.basel.com/en/city-map/districts/kleinbasels-old-town-wettstein).
