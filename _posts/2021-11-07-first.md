Today marks one month and 4 days since Victoria and I arrived in Basel, Switzerland.
We met six years ago in Montreal, where I had lived since I was 4 and a half years old.
After four years of PhD studies, I got an offer for a 2 year postdoc at [ETH Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich).
