Today marks one month and 4 days since Victoria and I arrived in Basel, Switzerland.
We met six years ago in Montreal, where I had lived since I was 4 and a half years old.
After four years of PhD studies, I got an offer for a 2 year postdoc at [ETH Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich).
There haven't been too many new beginnings in my life (at least not in my adult life) but this one certainly felt like a big one.
I would also say that this 'new begining' sometimes feels more like a 'new in-between'.
Having signed a letter to the immigration authorities that we would be leaving the country once my 2-year work contract expires certainly adds to that feeling.
Discussions of what will our lives look like in the not very distant future are very frequent.
Answering that question leads to many others about values, lifestyle, career, politics, and much more.
Not only does this feel like a big turning point in mine and Victoria's life but it certainly feels like the world is generating a lot of situations that need to be broken down and reflected on.
Hoping to gain some clarity, and record some nice memories and lessons, I felt the urge to write down what was happening during this period.
So this marks the beginning of the attempt at doing just that, from the point of view of everyday life.

Being in Switzerland has presented many firsts for us, and today is another one. 
We are about to go on our first corss-border walk.
The price of food (especially chicken breast, which is a staple in my North American diet) feels quite high here.
From our first inspections, 300g of chicken breast is costing around 7 CHF (approx. 10 CAD).
Cross-border shopping is especialy popular in Basel since it is nicely located ridiculously close to the border with France and Germany; Google Maps, and my preferred open source alternative, [OSM+](https://osmand.net/), estimate about a 35 minute walk to a grocery shop in [St Louis, France]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Louis,_Haut-Rhin).
We haven't yet figured out if we're going to buy a car, or use the seemingly popular car share service, [Mobility](https://www.mobility.ch/en/private-customers) so we're walking.
In any case, I've gotten used to a 30 minute walk to my office in [Kleinbasel](https://www.basel.com/en/city-map/districts/kleinbasels-old-town-wettstein).

As I wait for Victoria to be ready for our walk, I cycled through some of the books I have laying around the apartment.
Currently on my rotation is a ridiculous number of books (approx. 10).
I am trying out the breadth-first search strategy to book reading at the moment.
In several rooms of the apartment I have a stack of books (in the BFS metaphor it would more aptly be called a queue).
I take the top book and read it for a bit, then put it on the bottom of the stack.
Today was ['Mere Christianity' by CS Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_Christianity) where CS Lewis explains to a modern lay audience the core beliefs of Christianity from his point of view.
My first impression is that you can completely disagree with everything in that book and still find it incredibly valuable.
The clarity and simplicity with which CS Lewis takes on the worlds' most difficult questions is remarkable.
Very ealy in the book, he gets to a discussion of a question that had been bothering me for quite some time recently.
Can we explain the entirety of our moral behaviour through the lens of evolution?
Half of my university studies had been in Biology, and all of it sits on top of the theory of evolution.
