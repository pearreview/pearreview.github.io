## Brocki

We're slowly filling out our kitchen with second hand items.
Victoria and I like a melange of cutlery and dinnerware so we have been visiting the local Brocki shops.
These are shops that sell household items, often from homes where the owner has passed away.
This creates a good opportunity for finding low cost but quite high qualiity antique pieces.
You can find a list of Brocki shops [here](), the often take only cash so make sure you pull out some Frannies before heading over.



## COVID Aesthetics

Being at the Brocki and just walking around every day makes it hard to ignore the stark contrast one finds in Europe between old and new.
Postmodern 1960s cinderblocks in between ornate 18th century ruins.
In a sense today's debates on COVID crystallized this conflict.
I say this because if I were to chooe one feature to separate the old and new objects, I would classify an old thing by to the degree to which it makes sacrifices outside of its intended purpose.
A building with a carved decorative facade is just as much a building as a brutalist apartment building, yet the architects of the former sacrificed time and energy to something else.
It is undeniable that sacrifices of many forms have been made in the face of the COVID situation.
We have certainly made financial sacrifices, many would say that we have made sacrifices of liberty, health, sovereignty, spending time with loved ones, etc.
Before undertaking any sacrifice we implicitly or explicitly crunch some numbers to decide whether such a sacrifice is worth making.
We hope that when doing this, we are aware of all the relevant facts, and have sound judgement to digest these facts and turn them into action.
I would like to put this in a slightly mathematical framework purely because I think it can help people discuss controversial topics such as this one more harmoniously and productively. 

We can say that any individual or collective action stems from a decision that we make given a set of facts and values.
It is important to note that there are two distinct concepts involved here: facts, and values.
Values are not facts and facts are not values.
Nowhere in the world do we observe values.
We may observe a particular person behaving under a set of values (i.e. someone who values food highly will likely be found eating a lot of the time), but then we are observing a fact.
As CS Lewis elegantly put it:

> 

Facts consist in the concrete 'objective' state of affairs that the external world presents to us.
To each fact, we can assign a _value_ which we can think of as the degree to which that fact matters to us in the context of the decision at hand.
So for a set of facts $X = \{x_1, x_2, .., x_N \}$ we generate a corresponding set of values $\Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, .., \omega_N \}$ based on our own internal moral compass.
The ultimate decision is some combination of each fact, scaled by how much weight we assign to it through our values.

$$ \text{DECISION}(\Omega,X) = \textrm{sign} \big( w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 +  .. + w_N x_N \big) $$

Once we've combined all the facts (in this example, we have a sum), the quantity that comes out can be used to make a decision.
Here, our decision is given by the sign of the combined values.

A simple example. 

Need to decide whether I should run upstairs to get my umbrella but I'm running late for work. I undergo a decision process on two possible sets of facts; I go back for my umbrella or I do not. In the case where I do the set of facts is:

The facts (we arbitrarily encode as \(x = 1 \) if true, \(x = -1 \) if false):

1. Will I be on time for work?: \(x_1 = -1 \).
2. Will I be more comfortable on my walk to work \(x_2 = 1 \)$.

If I care a lot about comfort, and not so much about my job, I might take these facts and generate the value set: $\omega_1 = 0, \omega_2 = 1$.

So the outcome is \( \text{sign}(0 \cdot -1 + 1 \cdot +1) \) which is positive, so I go back for the umbrella.
You can imagine the converse happening in the other scenario.
You can also easily imagine that given the same set of facts, two people can come to opposing decisions.
And since value sets do not exist concretely in the world, we have a problem on our hands when value sets are not compatible.
It is tricky enough to agree on fact sets, but of course agreeing on values is often seen as impossible.
In any case, I think it is very important to notice that discussions can happen on two independent levels.


What seeing all of this contrast between beautiful ruins and streamilned modernity is that perhaps there is a factor that we are overlooking.
